    <p class="work-desc">If you aren’t aware, Imagine RIT is a festival that features student projects across all of RIT’s majors, but especially art and engineering. Thousands of families attend each year. Every fall, they hold a poster design contest, and I was a participant.</p>
    <img src="./extrude.png" class="temp-img">
    <p class="work-desc">This is one of my earliest “serious” projects, and for that reason I do not have any sketches. However, I would like to note this was made entirely by playing around with the extrude tool in illustrator. There are no actual 3D renderings in this image.</p>
    <img class="temp-img" src="./imagine1-prog.png">
    <p class="work-desc">The piece started with the two spirals of text, which resulted from a lot of experimentation with different settings. My original idea was to make it look like a nebula with stars, but I thought having symbolic objects like wrenches and paint palettes would be a more fitting idea. The green blobs are placeholders for more objects, which ended up being planets.</p>

    <p class="work-desc">Although I did not win, I am still very glad I made this, and it’s one of my most cherished personal projects. In 3D, our final project is to make an entry for the 2026 contest, so I will definitely be creating another!</p>
