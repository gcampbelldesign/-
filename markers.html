    <p class="work-desc">For this project, our task was to create a product in Cinema 4D of our choosing, then advertise it. I decided to create alcohol markers. Unsure what brand to choose, I created my own called “Chillmarkers”. I started with a PNG background of a marker and extruded a rounded cube and went from there. Each marker is a unique color with editable text for unlimited possibilities.</p>
    <img src="./render_1.png" class="temp-img">
    <p class="work-desc">I wanted a floaty, dreamy feel for my first rendering. Illuminating this took a lot of experimentation and preciseness, as I was new to lighting at the time.
      My only critique on this was to round out the text for the next part of the project, which I later implemented.</p>
    <img class="temp-img" src="./marker_dna_draft.png">
    <p class="work-desc">Then, I had a sudden revelation! I was brainstorming interesting ways I could arrange the markers, and with a lot of time, patience and grouping, I ended up building a DNA spiral. It’s not perfect, and I wasn’t satisfied with my first attempt, but it was an intriguing concept.</p>

      <img src="./dna_1.png" class="temp-img modify">
    </div>
    <p class="work-desc">While the project only called for one render, I thought the DNA concept might be too experimental, so I ended up doing two and seeing how the professor felt. However, the typography was crowded and lighting heavily lacked, especially in the dual tip advertisement.</p>

    <p class="work-desc">Here is the final version of my images, with crisper lighting/color correction, cleaner type treatment, and more emphasis focal points.</p>
